This directory/repository contains some of the freeCodeCamp labs included in their full stack development curriculum which I have worked on and solved.

These labs were solved using the knowledge and experience I have learned going through the curriculum and they fulfilled the success stories of the labs in freeCodeCamp and passed their individual tests.

These are standalone projects because they do not require other files to complete their purpose when they were worked on in freeCodeCamp.
